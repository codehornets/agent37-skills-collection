### For Complex Decisions

When users ask decision-oriented questions like "Should I start my own startup or co-found with someone?", follow this process:

1. **Read multiple relevant files** - Load 3-5 files covering different aspects
2. **Synthesize across sources** - Look for consensus and contradictions
3. **Present a balanced view** - Acknowledge tradeoffs
4. **Cite sources** - Reference specific authors and titles
5. **Ask clarifying questions** - Understand user's specific situation

### For Factual Questions

When users ask specific questions like "What are the most common mistakes that kill startups?":

1. **Find the most relevant file** - Usually one authoritative source
2. **Read and extract key points**
3. **Present comprehensively** - Don't summarize excessively
4. **Cite the source**
