Outro: Pivoting Process

It turns out many of the billion dollar companies you know and love today pivoted on the way to getting there, and

you know if that next idea is the one?

In **Office Hours**, we’ll feature Y Combinator’s [**Group Partners**](https://www.ycombinator.com/people) discussing
the startup topics that they know better than just about anyone else in the world, because they’ve built their own
successful startups and have advised thousands more.
