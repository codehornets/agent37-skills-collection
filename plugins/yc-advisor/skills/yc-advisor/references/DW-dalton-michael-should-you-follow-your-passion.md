Dalton Caldwell and Michael Seibel talk about solutions in search of a problem, whether or not to follow your passion,
how to figure out what to work on, and how to motivate yourself.   
  
We asked YC founders: Is there a simple fact you wish you knew when you started your company or a rookie mistake you
wish you could take back?
