Mind games. Awkward power moves. Investors showing up hours late, only to make no effort to seem interested.

Before any of us were Group Partners at YC, [**we were founders**](https://www.ycombinator.com/people). We know how it
feels to be in the hot seat when you’re raising money, and we’ve seen just how many ways an investor meeting can go
wrong.

For this latest episode of [**Office**\\
**Hours**](https://www.ycombinator.com/blog/introducing-our-newest-video-series-office-hours/), the Group Partners are
sharing stories from their worst investor meetings. We’ll outline some of the weird plays we’ve seen investors try to
pull — but we’ll also confess times that we, as founders, bungled meetings we could’ve nailed.
