Outro

_If you’ve spent any time on the startup side of Twitter, you’ve probably seen the word “ZIRP” thrown around. Usually_
_not in a positive way; often as a jab. But what is ZIRP?_

_ZIRP stands for “ **Z** ero **I** nterest **R** ate **P** henomenon,” and it refers to a stretch of time — most recently_
_throughout the pandemic — in which the Federal Reserve sets interest rates around 0% and commercial banks are able to_
_borrow money for next-to-nothing.  These banks want to find somewhere for this money to go — so it can, in turn, make_
_them more money. For a few recent years, that meant a lot of new cash rushing into VC and startups._

_A rush of money for startups might sound like a good thing, but it’s never that simple. Handled incorrectly, too much_
_money can be poison._

_In this episode of Dalton & Michael, we’ll talk about some of the downstream side effects we saw during this stretch:_
_an explosion of unicorns, a surge of new investors, and the impact it had on the way founders think. We’ll share the_
_advice we gave YC founders to brace them for the future, and how some companies made the right move in the middle of an_
_unusual/unsustainable moment. Michael and I aren’t economists, but we’ve seen some stuff; join us as we look back at how_
_it all played out._
