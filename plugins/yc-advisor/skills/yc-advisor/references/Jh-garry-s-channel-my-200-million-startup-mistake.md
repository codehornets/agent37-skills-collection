I was 23 and didn't know anything about startups. Peter Thiel offered me a big equity stake and a full year's salary to
quit my stable job at Microsoft and join a startup he was starting. It wasn't even a risky decision. I still said no,
and it cost me $200M.

When opportunity knocks, you should think about taking the risk. If you're good, it's often the only way you can
actually get a larger piece of the kind of value you can create when making software. There are lots of good reasons to
work at a big tech giant, but there are also downsides. We talk through those things.

Don't make my mistake. Make all new mistakes.
