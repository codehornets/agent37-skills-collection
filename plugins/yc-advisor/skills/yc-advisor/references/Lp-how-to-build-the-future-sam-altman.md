Outro: Advice for early founders + final thoughts

At OpenAI, Sam Altman and his team have overseen monumental leaps forward in machine learning, generative AI, and most
recently, LLMs that can reason at PhD levels. And this is just the beginning. In his latest essay Sam predicted that ASI
(Artificial Super Intelligence) is just a few thousand days away. So how did we get to this point?

In this episode of our rebooted series "How To Build The Future," YC President and CEO Garry Tan sits down with Sam to
talk about the origins of OpenAI, what’s next for the company, and what advice he has for founders navigating this
massive platform shift.
