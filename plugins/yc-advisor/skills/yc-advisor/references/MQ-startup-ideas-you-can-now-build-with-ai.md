Outro

There's never been a better time to start an AI company. Not just because there are new ideas, but because the tech
finally makes old ones actually work.

On the Lightcone, Garry, Harj, Diana and Jared talk through the kinds of startups that are suddenly viable thanks to
LLMs—from full-stack law firms to personalized tutors to recruiting platforms that can finally scale. They share the
patterns they're seeing, the ideas they're excited about, and what it means to live at the edge of the future, where
breakthroughs often look like second chances.

If you've been waiting for the right moment to build, this is it.
