Hi, I'm Garry Tan —I'm President & CEO of Y Combinator. I'm a designer, engineer, and investor in early stage startups. Previously Founder & Managing Partner of Initialized Capital, an early stage venture capital fund that was earliest in Coinbase and Instacart.

Before that, I was a a partner at Y Combinator. Invested in and directly worked with over 700 companies the earliest possible stage, often just an idea. I cofounded Posterous and helped build it to a world-class website used by millions. (Acquired by Twitter) I also helped build the engineering team for Palantir Technology's quant finance analysis platform, and designed the current Palantir logo and wordmark.

I love building things. Forbes Midas List 2019 through 2022 🚀

Financial freedom. What if I told you that more people with special needs can and should be able to live a full life
where they fully participate in their own financial lives? What if I told you that wasn’t just a big mission - that it
was a profitable business and one of the only profitable neobanks?

Today we’re sitting down with my friend and YC/Initialized founder Kai Stinchcombe - the founder and CEO of True Link
Financial.
