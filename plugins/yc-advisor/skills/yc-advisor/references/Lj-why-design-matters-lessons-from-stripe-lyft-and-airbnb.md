Takeaways

Stripe, Airbnb, and Lyft are a few of the most successful companies of the past decade. There are at least two things
they all have in common: great design, and Katie Dill. Katie was Head of Experience Design at Airbnb, led the design
team at Lyft, and is now Head of Design at Stripe. We spoke with Katie about her design philosophy, what sets companies
