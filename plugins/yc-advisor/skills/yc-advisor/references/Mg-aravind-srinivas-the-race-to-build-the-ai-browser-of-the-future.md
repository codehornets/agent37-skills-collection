Audience Q&A

Aravind Srinivas on June 16, 2025 at AI Startup School in San Francisco.

Aravind Srinivas started Perplexity with one goal: to rethink how we search, browse, and interact with information
online. In this conversation, he shares the journey from hacking together a natural-language-to-SQL search tool to
building a product used by millions around the world.

He talks about the big bet on the AI-powered browser, why agents—not just chatbots—are the next step, and how speed,
accuracy, and focus help a startup compete against giants. Along the way, he reflects on co-founder dynamics, early
technical challenges, and what it takes to keep building when the biggest players in the world are racing alongside you.
