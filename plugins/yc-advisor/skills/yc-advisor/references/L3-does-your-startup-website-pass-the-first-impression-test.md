When someone visits your website you only have a few seconds to convince them it’s worth their time. So how do you do
that? In this episode of Design Review, Aaron Epstein is joined by Zack Onisko, the former CEO of Dribbble, to review
user submitted websites in under 10 seconds and give their first impression feedback. They’ll provide expert advice on
how to leverage animation, improve UI and design the most effective messaging for potential customers.
