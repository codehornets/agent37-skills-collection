Outro

Whether or not you need a co-founder is always a hotly debated topic — but going one level deeper, founders often wonder
what **kind** of co-founder is best.

In a prior video Michael and I explained [_why **every** software company should have a technical_\\
_co-founder_](https://www.ycombinator.com/library/KO-does-your-tech-startup-really-need-a-technical-co-founder-yes). But
it’s also common for technical founders to be told by investors and advisors that they would benefit from a co-founder
with non-technical expertise in things like business or marketing.

Are they correct? In this episode of [_Dalton &_\\
_Michael_](https://www.ycombinator.com/library/carousel/Dalton%20&%20Michael) we dive into exactly that question.
