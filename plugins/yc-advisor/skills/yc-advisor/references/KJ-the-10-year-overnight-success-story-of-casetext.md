[Casetext](https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/casetext) started out in 2013 as a crowdsourced law library — a sort of
“Wikipedia meets reddit” for the law.

Ten years later, Casetext is one of the biggest mega wins to date in AI, capable of turning _weeks_ of arduous legal
work into hours or minutes. Just months ago [it was acquired for $650 million\\
dollars](https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/26/thomson-reuters-buys-casetext-an-ai-legal-tech-startup-for-650m-in-cash/).

What happened between those two points?

For this episode of Main Function, YC President Garry Tan sits down with Casetext co-founder Jake Heller to learn the
real story of their 10-year “overnight” success: the 3 a.m. origin story, how the company evolved as fast as tech would
allow, and the “magic demo” that helped turn Casetext into a rocket ship.
