In this video, Y Combinator partners Michael Seibel and Dalton Caldwell discuss the importance of having honest and
difficult conversations with startup founders.

While having hard conversations can be uncomfortable, Seibel and Caldwell argue that this transparency is essential for
founders to grow and ultimately, these experiences help founders have their own hard conversations that they've been
avoiding with the people around them.
