Outro

MIT's new State of AI in Business report went viral for claiming that 95% of enterprise AI projects fail. But the real
story isn't that AI doesn't work — it's just big companies can't build it.

In this episode of the Lightcone, Garry, Harj, Diana, and Jared break down what the study really says, why in-house
enterprise AI efforts keep stalling, and how startups are filling the gap with products that learn, integrate, and
actually deliver value.
