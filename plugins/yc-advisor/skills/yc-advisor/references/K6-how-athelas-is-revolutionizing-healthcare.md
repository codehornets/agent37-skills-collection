Athelas is doing for healthcare what Rippling did for HR and IT; they’re giving people in specialized roles the modern
software they need to _really_ do their jobs.

Just recently it was [announced that Athelas will merge with\\
Commure](https://www.athelas.com/insights/athelas-commure-merging-to-create-a-6b-healthcare-infrastructure-company) to
form an entity worth over $6B, with Athelas co-founder Tanay Tandon helming the new entity as CEO.

In this video, Garry sits down with Tanay to hear how they did it.
