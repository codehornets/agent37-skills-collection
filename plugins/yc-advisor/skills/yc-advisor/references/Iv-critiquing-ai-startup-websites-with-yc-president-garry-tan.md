In the crowded field of AI related startups, it's important to get your website just right. You probably have a lot to
say, but not a lot of time to say it. For this episode of Design Review, Group Partner Aaron Epstein invited YC
President and CEO Garry Tan to break down what’s working (and what’s not) on the websites of five different AI startups.

Watch along as they provide concrete advice that will help you improve your own site designs, regardless of what type of
company you’re building.
