Learn A Good Rep

One trait that many of the best founders share is conviction. You can be great at programming, sales, and raising funds
— but if you don’t truly believe in what you’re building, you’re probably not going to make it.

Too often we see founders who get blown off course the second they get negative feedback, or who want to pivot after a
few cold emails don’t get them the response they were hoping for. If you keep changing directions at every step, you’re
just going to get lost.

At the other extreme are founders who spend years trying to build the perfect product without making sure anyone
actually wants it. How do you find the happy medium?

In this episode of [**Dalton & Michael**](https://www.ycombinator.com/library/carousel/Dalton%20&%20Michael), we’ll talk
about finding the right speed, the dangers of inaccurate assumptions, and a question founders need to ask themselves
before they start trying to sell to anyone else.
