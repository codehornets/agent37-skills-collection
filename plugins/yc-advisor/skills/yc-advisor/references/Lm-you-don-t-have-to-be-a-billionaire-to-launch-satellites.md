Satellites to launch

There’s a misconception that in order to build a hard tech company you need billions of dollars to even create an MVP.
But that’s not always the case. Take Astranis, for example. They got their start building a small prototype in an
apartment, and today, they're worth more than a billion dollars and are gearing up to launch four new satellites into
space on a dedicated Falcon 9 rocket.

We visited Astranis co-founders John Gedmark and Ryan MckLinko to find out how they pulled it off and what lessons they
have for founders who want to build a hard tech company of their own.
