Final Advice for Founders

Amjad Masad started Replit to make programming accessible to anyone, anywhere. What began as a tool for learning to code
has grown into a platform pushing the limits of AI-assisted software creation and recently surpassed $100M in ARR.

On The Breakdown with Tom and Dave, Amjad shares the journey from his early days in Jordan, working on open-source
projects, to leading Replit through major pivots from "teach a billion people to code" to "let anyone build software."
He discusses the evolving nature of programming, the future of work, and the next generation of human-computer
collaboration.
