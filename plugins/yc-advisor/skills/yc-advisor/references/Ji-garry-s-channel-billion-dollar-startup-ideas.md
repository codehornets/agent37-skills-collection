What makes you new, different, and unique in the world will often be the exact thing that makes you succeed. Embrace
your differences, and you’ll find something amazing in there. Learn how founders like Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, Ryan
Petersen of Flexport, and Jack Conte of Patreon did exactly that: learn things from unique personal experiences that put
them on the right path.

And if you can do that, you avoid infinite competition. You can make something truly awesome.
