DevTools are more popular than ever. But having a great product isn't enough — you have to be able to convince
developers to try it out. One of the best ways to do that is with a well designed website.

In this episode of Design Review our host Aaron Epstein is joined by David Siegel, founder and CEO of the no-code app
builder Glide to critique five startup DevTool sites. They'll highlight key tips and advice for designing the best
possible DevTools site for your business.
