Outro

Founders making a decision to start a company often find themselves torn between “bootstrapping” (i.e. not raising money
from venture capitalists) or trying to fundraise from VCs.

The fact is, the vast majority of businesses don't raise VC and that is often an excellent decision. Many do, and that
can be great too!

In this episode of [Dalton & Michael](https://www.ycombinator.com/library/carousel/Dalton%20&%20Michael), we’ll explain
why this particular debate is a much simpler one than many make it out to be.
