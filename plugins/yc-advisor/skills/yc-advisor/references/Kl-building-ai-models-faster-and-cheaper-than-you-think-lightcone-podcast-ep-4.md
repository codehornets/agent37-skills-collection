Outro

If you read articles about companies like OpenAI and Anthropic training foundation models, it would be natural to assume
that if you don’t have a billion dollars or the resources of a large company, you can’t train your own foundational
models. But the opposite is true.

In this episode of the Lightcone Podcast, we discuss the strategies to build a foundational AI model with examples of YC
companies doing just that. We also get an exclusive look at OpenAI's Sora!
