Outro

Over the past decade crypto has been declared dead hundreds of times. But with the price of Bitcoin surging over the
past few months it’s clear that there are still enormous opportunities in this space.

Few people know that better than Chandan Lodha, the co-founder of CoinTracker (W18), a crypto asset management and tax
filing platform. He and his team have navigated several boom and bust cycles over the years.

In this latest episode of The Main Function, you’ll hear about how they built their company, the time it nearly fell
apart, and how they used a crypto winter to retool and emerge stronger than ever.
