Outro

YC Group Partner Dalton Caldwell shares his strategies for how to think about applying to YC. This talk goes beyond the
information on YC's website, and reflects Dalton's latest advice on the topic. (Fun Fact: An earlier version of this
talk is frequently mentioned by YC founders as instrumental in their decision to apply to YC and to getting in!)
