– What It’s Like to Work at Legora

At 23, with no legal background, Max Junestrand co-founded Legora to transform how lawyers work. Today, Legora’s AI
workspace is used by tens of thousands of lawyers, including top law firms like Goodwin and Cleary Gottlieb— and is
valued at $675M just 13 months after launch.

From due diligence grids that turn days of work into minutes, to Word integrations that renegotiate contracts, Max sat
down with YC General Partner Gustaf Alstromer to share how Legora won over skeptical firms, scaled from 10 to 100
people, and built a new category in legal AI.
