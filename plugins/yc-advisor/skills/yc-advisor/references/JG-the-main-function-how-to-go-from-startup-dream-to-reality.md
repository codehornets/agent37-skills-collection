Outro

It can be very easy for founders to fall into a trap of denial in the early stages of a startup’s life. But in order for
your company to really take off, it’s critical to be honest with yourself and to build a community of friends and
collaborators who are willing to challenge groupthink.

In the first episode of our new series “The Main Function,” YC President and CEO Garry Tan explains how founders must
face hard truths in order to take their company from dream to reality.
