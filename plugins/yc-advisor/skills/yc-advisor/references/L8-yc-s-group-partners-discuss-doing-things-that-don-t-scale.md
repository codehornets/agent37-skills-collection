Outro

A little over ten years ago Paul Graham published the essay " [Do Things That Don't\\
Scale](https://www.ycombinator.com/library/96-do-things-that-don-t-scale)".

At the time, it was controversial advice that spoke to the drastically different needs of an early startup versus the
needs of a much larger, more established company.

In this episode of Office Hours, YC Partners discuss PG's essay, its influence on Silicon Valley, and some prime
examples of YC founders that embraced the mantra.
