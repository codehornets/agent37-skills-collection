Outro

At first, prompting seemed to be a temporary workaround for getting the most out of large language models. But over
time, it's become critical to the way we interact with AI.

On the Lightcone, Garry, Harj, Diana, and Jared break down what they've learned from working with hundreds of founders
building with LLMs: why prompting still matters, where it breaks down, and how teams are making it more reliable in
production.

They share real examples of prompts that failed, how companies are testing for quality, and what the best teams are
doing to make LLM outputs useful and predictable.
