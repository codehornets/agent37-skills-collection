Hi, I'm Garry Tan —I'm President & CEO of Y Combinator. I'm a designer, engineer, and investor in early stage startups. Previously Founder & Managing Partner of Initialized Capital, an early stage venture capital fund that was earliest in Coinbase and Instacart.

Before that, I was a a partner at Y Combinator. Invested in and directly worked with over 700 companies the earliest possible stage, often just an idea. I cofounded Posterous and helped build it to a world-class website used by millions. (Acquired by Twitter) I also helped build the engineering team for Palantir Technology's quant finance analysis platform, and designed the current Palantir logo and wordmark.

I love building things. Forbes Midas List 2019 through 2022 🚀
