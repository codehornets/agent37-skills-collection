Outro

As LLM’s become exponentially better it is clear that vertical AI agents are key to the next generation of billion
dollar SaaS companies. In this episode of the Lightcone, the hosts sit down with YC alum Jake Heller, the co-founder and
CEO of Casetext (which sold to Thomson Reuters for $650 million in 2023) to discuss what it takes to build a successful
vertical AI company and overcome resistance from industry veterans and skeptics.
