Outro

For the past 15 years, tech policies and agendas in Washington D.C. have been predominantly influenced by the biggest
technology companies (i.e., Big Tech). However, as D.C. and Silicon Valley experience increasing interactions and
friction over rapidly evolving technologies, it's crucial for startups (i.e., Little Tech, the emerging tech keeping our
economy dynamic) to have their voices heard in policy and regulatory discussions.

In this episode of The Main Function, Y Combinator’s new Head of Public Policy, Luther Lowe, sits down with President
and CEO Garry Tan to discuss why YC is advocating for the startup community and which policy issues are most important
to founders.
