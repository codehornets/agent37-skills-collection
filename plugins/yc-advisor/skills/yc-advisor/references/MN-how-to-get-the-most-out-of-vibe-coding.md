Outro

AI can’t yet one-shot an entire product—but with the rise of vibe coding, supercharged developers are getting close.

Part intuition and experimentation, part validation, it's the new frontier of software development.

YC's Tom Blomfield has spent the last month building side projects with tools like Claude Code, Windsurf, and Aqua,
seeing just how far you can push modern LLMs. From writing full-stack apps to debugging with a single copy paste of an
error message, AI is becoming a legit collaborator in the dev process.

With tips from YC founders in the Spring batch, this is a playbook for anyone who wants to get the most out of vibe
coding and build faster.
