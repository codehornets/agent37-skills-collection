Conclusion

In this first in-person episode, Michael Seibel and Dalton Caldwell reveal how startups can gain a competitive advantage
by doing something deceptively simple. They share compelling stories of companies that built loyal relationships and
achieved success by making personal connections with users.

In contrast, they discuss the traps early-stage founders make by trying to emulate big tech. If you want to build a
business that customers love and that thrives in the long run, this advice on why caring deeply about your customers is
key.
