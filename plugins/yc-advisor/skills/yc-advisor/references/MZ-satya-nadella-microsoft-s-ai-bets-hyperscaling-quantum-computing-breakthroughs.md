A fireside with Satya Nadella on June 17, 2025 at AI Startup School in San Francisco.

Satya Nadella started at Microsoft in 1992 as an engineer. Three decades later, he’s now Chairman & CEO, navigating the
company through one of the most profound technological shifts yet: the rise of AI.

In this conversation, he shares how Microsoft is thinking about this moment— from the infrastructure needed to train
frontier models, to the social permission required to use that compute. He draws parallels to the early PC and internet
eras, breaks down what makes a great team, and reflects on what he’d build if he were starting his career today.
