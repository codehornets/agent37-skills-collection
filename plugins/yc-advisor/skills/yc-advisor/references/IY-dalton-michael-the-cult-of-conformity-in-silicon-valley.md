Grand Takeaways

What happens when the unconventional becomes conventional? Michael Seibel and Dalton Caldwell discuss how the startup
world has changed from being dominated by outsiders and nonconformists to now attracting more mainstream conformists
looking for status and money. They share stories of what the tech scene was like when they were in school - and how
radically different it is today.

Dalton and Michael offer advice about navigating a world that doesn't always reward nonconformists embarking on risky
entrepreneurial journeys. Don't just think different, act different.
