Outro

If you’re an employee of a late-stage company right now, how would you know when it’s time to move on vs. time to double
down?

It’s an especially pertinent question today; the late stage funding market is… slow and the IPO window is still
effectively closed. Is this a good time for employees to consider working for a smaller/earlier stage company?

The fact is there isn't an easy answer — it can really vary from person to person, and situation to situation. In this
episode of [**Dalton + Michael**](https://www.ycombinator.com/library/carousel/Dalton%20&%20Michael), Michael and I
share some suggestions on what sort of things an employee of a late-stage startup should be looking for — the good signs
and the bad — to best make this decision.
