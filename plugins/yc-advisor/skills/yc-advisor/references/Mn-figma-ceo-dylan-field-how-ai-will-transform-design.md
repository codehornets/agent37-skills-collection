Dylan Field on June 17th, 2025 at AI Startup School in San Francisco.

Dylan Field co-founded Figma to bring the design process online and make it multiplayer. From a meme maker built on
WebGL to a design platform powering millions, Figma’s journey hit a major milestone with its IPO last week.

In this conversation, Dylan shares the early challenges of building in the browser, the early risks and pivotal choices
that shaped Figma’s growth, the principles that guided its product and community, and how he thinks about building tools
that empower creativity at scale.
