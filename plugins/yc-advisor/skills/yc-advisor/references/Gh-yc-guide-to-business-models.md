Here are the nine most common business models we see in startups:

## **SaaS (Software as a Service)**

Cloud-based subscription software

**PRIMARY METRICS:**

- **Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR)** or **Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR)**
- **Growth Rate:** Measured weekly or monthly
- **Net Revenue Retention:** % of recurring revenue retained from a prior period
- **CAC:** Costs to acquire a new customer

**TAKEAWAYS:**

- All the benefits of recurring revenue
- Can have non-recurring revenue, but don’t include in ARR/MRR
- Usually sold to businesses, ideally on annual contracts
- Growth can be driven by direct sales, self-serve acquisition channels, or both

## **Transactional**

Facilitate transactions and take a cut

**PRIMARY METRICS:**

- **Gross Transaction Value (GTV):** Total payment volume transacted
- **Net Revenue:** Fees charged for transactions (often a %)
- **User Retention:** % of month 1 customers that make a purchase in month 2, etc
- **CAC**

**TAKEAWAYS:**

- Usually fintech and payments businesses
- One-time transactions rather than recurring
- Often high volume with a low fee (1-3% is common)
- Best transactional businesses have extremely consistent revenue from high repeat usage

## **Marketplaces**

Facilitate transactions between buyers and sellers

**PRIMARY METRICS:**

- **Gross Merchandise Value (GMV):** Total sales volume transacted
- **Net Revenue:** Fees charged for transactions (often a % take rate)
- **Growth Rate**
- **User Retention:** % of month 1 customers that make a purchase in month 2, etc

**TAKEAWAYS:**

- Hard to get off the ground, chicken & egg problem
- Need to scale supply and demand in sync
- Network effects at scale drive exponential growth
- When they work, often become dominant winner-take-all winners

## **Subscription**

Product or service sold on a recurring basis, usually to consumers

**PRIMARY METRICS:**

- **Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR)** or **Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR)**
- **Growth Rate:** Measured weekly or monthly
- **User Retention:** % of month 1 customers that make a purchase in month 2, etc
- **CAC**

**TAKEAWAYS:**

- Recurring revenue is the most valuable revenue
- Usually sold to consumers, often paying monthly
- Usually lower price points, from a higher volume of customers
- Growth driven by scalable, self-serve acquisition channels

## **Enterprise**

Sell large fixed-term contracts to big companies (5k+ employees)

![uploaded image](https://www.ycombinator.com/media/?key=user_uploads/206006/e8109d8b-672a-462e-a6a1-50a659719875&type=article&id=1035)

**PRIMARY METRICS:**

- **Bookings:** Total _signed_ contract value (recurring + non-recurring)
- **Revenue:** Recognized when delivering on the contract
- **Annual Contract Value (ACV):** Total contract value / # of years
- **Pipeline:** Top of funnel → Demo → Close

**TAKEAWAYS:**

- Very few customers, much larger deals ($100k+/year)
- Growth driven by direct sales
- Often begin with paid pilots or LOIs
- Usually long sales cycles, with many gatekeepers
- The buyer is not always the end user
- Lumpy growth: measuring m/m growth rate doesn't make as much sense

## **Usage Based**

Pay-as-you-go based on consumption in a given period

**PRIMARY METRICS:**

- **Monthly Revenue** (not recurring!)
- **Growth Rate**
- **Revenue Retention:** % of revenue from last month’s customers in this month
- **Gross Margin: Revenue - Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)**

**TAKEAWAYS:**

- Don’t confuse usage-based revenue with recurring revenue
- Charge per API request, # of records, data usage, etc
- Grow as your customers grow
- Product and pricing scale to support tiny startups to large enterprises

## **E-commerce**

Sell products online

![uploaded image](https://www.ycombinator.com/media/?key=user_uploads/206006/3b5bb52e-d664-47a9-9de6-39f07f070b3b&type=article&id=1035)

**PRIMARY METRICS:**

- **Monthly Revenue:** Total sales
- **Growth Rate:** Measured weekly or monthly
- **Gross Margin/Unit Economics:** Revenue - Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)
- **CAC**

**TAKEAWAYS:**

- Includes D2C brands and Shopify stores
- Not marketplaces, so keep 100% of each sale
- Higher COGS = lower margins
- Products often commoditized
- Need to be excellent at user acquisition and operations/unit economics

## **Advertising**

Sell ads to monetize free users

**PRIMARY METRICS:**

- **Daily Active Users (DAU):** Unique users active in a 24 hour period
- **Monthly Active Users (MAU):** Unique users active in a 28 day period
- **User Retention: % of active users on D1/7/30/etc**
- **CPM (Cost Per Thousand)** or **CPC (Cost Per Click)**

**TAKEAWAYS:**

- Typically consumer social products with huge scale
- Customer is the advertiser, not the end user
- Users are the product being sold
- Need billions of impressions each month
- Registered Users is a vanity metric

## **Hardtech/Bio/Moonshots**

Hard businesses with lots of technical risk and long time horizons

**PRIMARY METRICS:**

- **Milestones:** Progress towards the long-term vision
- **Signed contracts**
- **Letters of Intent (LOIs):** Non-binding contracts indicating interest to purchase

**TAKEAWAYS:**

- Often take years to get to a live product because of technical and/or regulatory risk
- Impressive technical milestones or experimental data can de-risk the tech
- Revenue is often years away, so signed LOIs are usually the best way to show customer interest
