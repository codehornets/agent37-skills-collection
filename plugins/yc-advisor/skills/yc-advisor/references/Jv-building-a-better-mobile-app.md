Outro

There’s a lot to think about when designing mobile apps, where seemingly small details can have a big impact. Viewers
have been asking for a mobile-focused episode of Design Review — and here it is!

[Design Review](https://www.ycombinator.com/library/carousel/Design%20Review) is our series that lets startups volunteer
to have their websites (or in this case, their mobile apps) put under the microscope by two design experts. For this
episode, series host and YC Group Partner [Aaron Epstein](https://www.ycombinator.com/people/aaron) is joined by [David\\
Siegel](https://twitter.com/dvdsgl?lang=en), co-founder and CEO of the no-code app builder
[Glide](https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/glide). Having previously been a Head of Design at companies like
Microsoft and Xamarin, Siegel has spent much of his career thinking about how to take all of the pieces and make them
fit together _just_ right.

**They’ll cover concepts like:**

- Thinking about context and _where users actually are_ when using an app
- Getting users to the “Aha!” moment as quickly as possible
- How good design uses color and animation for more than just looks
- Why it’s important to watch someone use your app out in the real world

The startups featured in this episode are [Pyrls](https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/pyrls),
[Bluedot](https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/bluedot), [Duffl](https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/duffl),
[BoldVoice](https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/boldvoice), and
[EdenCare](https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/eden-care). You can click any of those company names to find out what
each of the apps is built to do… or, better yet, you can work that out in real-time along with Aaron and David.
