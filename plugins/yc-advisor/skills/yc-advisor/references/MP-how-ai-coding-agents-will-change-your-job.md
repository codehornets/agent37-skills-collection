Advice for future founders

Coding agents are no longer a distant idea—they're already starting to reshape how we work.

YC's Tom Blomfield and David Lieb discuss how AI coding tools are transforming software development, why small,
high-agency teams will be able to do what once took armies of engineers, and why there's never been a better time to
start something new.

They explore the bigger picture too: a future where there's abundance, knowledge work becomes more accessible, and
founders have more leverage than ever before.

If you're thinking about building, there's no better moment than right now.
