When it comes to building a startup you’re never doing it entirely from scratch. Inspiration and ideas can come from a
variety of places, including other successful startups. But there’s a thin line between borrowing smart ideas and
copying them without much thought — otherwise known as “cargo culting.”  
  
In this episode Dalton and Michael break down the problem with cargo culting and offer advice on the right way to draw
inspiration from other successful companies.
