Summary

As Dalton & Michael have discussed before, ZIRP stands for “Zero Interest Rate Policy” which refers to when the Federal
Reserve sets interest rates around 0% and banks were able to borrow money for almost nothing. This phenomenon had a
profound impact on tech throughout the pandemic and many companies are still readjusting.

In this episode, Dalton & Michael examine how to know whether your company is recovering from a bad case of ZIRP (aka
Zirpes) and how to know if it may be time to leave and do something else.
