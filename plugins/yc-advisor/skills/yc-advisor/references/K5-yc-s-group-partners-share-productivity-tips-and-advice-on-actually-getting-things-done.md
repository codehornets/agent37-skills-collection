Outro

For this episode of [**Office**\\
**Hours**](https://www.ycombinator.com/blog/introducing-our-newest-video-series-office-hours), YC's Group Partners are
talking about productivity — what works for the founders they help, and, perhaps more importantly, what _doesn’t_.

In many cases, it’s about taking just a _bit_ of time to get introspective; is that trendy new productivity tool
actually helping you get things done faster, or would a simple notes app/spreadsheet work better with the way you think?
How do you know if a task is real work or “fake” work — the stuff that _feels_ like work, but isn’t actually moving your
startup forward?
