Takeaway

The core secret to startup success isn't fundraising or growth hacking - it's solving your customer's biggest problems.
But most founders are afraid to really understand those problems. What if that fear is holding your startup back?

In this video, Group Partners Dalton Caldwell and Michael Seibel share how companies like Google, Twitch, and Microsoft
succeeded by first giving more value than they captured - and how you can too. Learn why your MVP might suck on purpose,
how to change your customer outreach, and why you should understand exactly how your customers make money. Because when
you solve the right problems, fundraising and scaling become the easy parts.
