Outro

YC Group Partner Diana Hu was the CTO of her YC startup Escher Reality, which was acquired by Niantic (makers of Pokemon
Go). She shares her advice for being a technical founder at the earliest stages - including topics like how to ship an
MVP fast, how to deal with technology choices and technical debt, and how and when to hire an engineering team.
