Protecting Open Source and the Future of AI

Andrew Ng on June 17, 2025 at AI Startup School in San Francisco.

Andrew Ng has helped shape some of the most influential movements in modern AI—from online education to deep learning to
AI entrepreneurship.

In this talk, he shares what he’s learning now: why execution speed matters more than ever, how agentic workflows are
changing what startups can build, and why concreteness beats vagueness when turning ideas into products. He reflects on
the rise of AI coding assistants, the shifting bottlenecks in product development, and why, despite faster software,
it’s still human judgment and responsibility that will shape what comes next.
