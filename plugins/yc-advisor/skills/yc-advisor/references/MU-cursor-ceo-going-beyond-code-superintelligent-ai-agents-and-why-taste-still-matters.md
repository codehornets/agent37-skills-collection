Looking ahead

Michael Truell, co-founder and CEO of Anysphere, the company behind Cursor, joins Garry to talk about building one of
the fastest-growing startups of all time—and why he's betting on a future beyond code. He walks through the early
insights that led his team to leave a promising AI-powered CAD project and instead chase a bigger dream: reinventing how
software is written.

From years of false starts and rewrites to Cursor's breakthrough moment, Michael explains what it takes to build a tool
that could eventually replace programming as we know it. He also reflects on their first 10 hires, why taste still
matters, and how the decade ahead will unlock a new kind of creativity for builders everywhere.
