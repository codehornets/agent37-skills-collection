Outro

Earlier this month, OpenAI raised the largest venture round ever, at $6.6 billion. The company’s CFO says AI is now at
the point where orders of magnitude matter, and the next generation of models will be capital-intensive. In this episode
of Lightcone, the hosts consider what a world with ultra-intelligent models would look like and what potential unlocks
could be made possible.
