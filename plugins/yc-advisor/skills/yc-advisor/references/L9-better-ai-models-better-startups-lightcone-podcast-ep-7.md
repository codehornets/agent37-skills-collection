Outro

There's been a lot of news lately about the updates to some of the largest foundational AI models. But what does this
mean for startups? How will future product releases from the AI giants effect the companies built on top of them? The
hosts of Lightcone discuss how founders can take advantage of these developments and avoid being steamrolled by the
competition.
